## The tasks of the topic "Babel"

There is a simple project.

Configure `Babel` for this project to compile files inside `src`, so that:

1. Files are in root of the folder `src` wonâ€™t be changed after compilation
2. All files that are in the folder `src/lib` will be compiled by `Babel` with the preset `preset-env`

If you use any extras dependencies describe them in the `package.json`, as appropriate.
